                <p>
                  Ariana was in a car accident that resulted in two collapsed lungs, two broken legs, a broken collarbone, and a broken wrist. She was forced to retire from gymnstics and had to have 4 surgeries to repare the damage. She was in a lot of pain for a long time. She wasn't able to do gymnsatics and instead ended up breakdancing for a while to get back into the groove of things. Breakdancing is what brought her back to gymnastics.

                  <p> "If you are gonna do a sit-up, then you do that sit-up to the very best that you can. You don't take anything for granted, you don't assume that you have tomorrow. Everything that we do in life is a choice and those choices dictate the kind of life you're gonna lead. And as soon as you can understand that, then you satrt to take ownership of your life. You start to design your life to turnout whatever way you want."   </p>
